My fifth attempt at creating a store app, based on the Dennis Archakov stream "React Sneakers".
And now getting started with Create React App.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].
Ð•he project also includes:
- React + hooks
- React Router
- React Context
- Axios
- node-sass v.4.14.1 + scss-module
- mockAPI

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
